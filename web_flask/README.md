Web Flask
-Understanding python backend(flask) and jinja 2 templating.

Files 0 - 6 were introductory tasks familiarizing myself with using Flask. Files 7 forward involved gradually putting together more and more complex Jinja templates based on the HBnB HTML pages.

The most complete Flask/Jinja app-template combo in this directory is defined in Flask module 100-hbnb.py and Jinja template 100-hbnb.html.

To run the Flask app, execute the following command from the root directory of the project:

~ $ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost
HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m web_flask.100-hbnb
The app can be accessed at 0.0.0.0:5000/hbnb.
